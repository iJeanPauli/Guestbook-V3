****WARNING!****
You don't actually have to read this README!
It has nothing to do with the functionality or about installing this thing.
If you pull this it's basically just another Visual Studio Repo.
****WARNING!****

Look this is just something for school.
Nothing interesting just some basic stuff to do with some database.

Then why not make it private you say?
Well I shared it with some classmates and it was easier to make it public and shit.

Now idk if this is good or if this is what the teacher wanted but it is what i wanted so screw that.
BYE!
